## Prospective Students
We are always looking for PhD students whose research interests align closely with us! To learn more about our research themes, checkout [PoRTaL research](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/research/). 
If you are a prospective PhD student, we ask that you do not contact us directly with regard to PhD admissions until after you are admitted, as we will not be able to reply to emails from individual applicants. Instead, please mention that you are interested in working with us in your application, and we'll reach out during the admissions process. 

## Undergraduate / MS Researchers
We love working with motivated, independent undergrads / MS students at Cornell who have hands on experience in either developing ML models or building robot systems! If you are interested, please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDJ01HWm-19vNXee8b7r5Qg4CUKi8p8LhofrDvl_gg7I86Fg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
