I am an Assistant Professor at Cornell Computer Science where I lead the [People and Robot Teaching and Learning (PoRTaL)](https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/) group. 

My research aims to build robots that work seamlessly alongside human partners in the wild. To this end, my work focuses on imitation learning, decision making and human robot interaction. I am interested in domains where a robot continually interacts with humans such as collaborative mobile manipulation and self-driving.  

I work part-time at [Aurora](https://aurora.tech/), where we use machine learning to enable safe, human-like driving. I did my Postdoc at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and Ph.D. in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/). 
Much of my research has been deployed on real-world robot systems &mdash; [full-scale helicopters](https://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2018/AACUS--Robert-Collier-Trophy), [self-driving cars](https://youtu.be/99kN1SVqjjA), and [mobile manipulators](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/09/26/robots-abilities-to-recognise-and-manipulate-things-are-improving).
