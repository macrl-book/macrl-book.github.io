A set of practical tools to build decision making
procedures for machines interacting with the world. Our applications vary from video games and web-search to robot manipulation and 
self-driving vehicles. Our focus is on intuition and informal mathematical argument to build that intuition, and on 
techniques we've seen work multiple times on hard decision making problems. We try to outline the techniques and ways of
thinking we'd be most likely to pull out in practice. Throughout, we attempt to point to rigorous derivations and the 
original literature on the topics.
